## Challenge Summary
In summary, the election commission can use this script with some modifications for any election based on: 
1) Updating the script based on the number of counties which cast votes for the election results outcome
2) Updating the script based on the number of candidates for the election results outcome

Additionally, if further data points can be provided such as gender or age, more breakdowns of the data can be conducted for each county and candidate.
